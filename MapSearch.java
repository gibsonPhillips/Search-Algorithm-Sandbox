	 * the same number of vertices as the original one, BUT you only add an edge to the copy
	 * if the edge in the original graph IS NOT involved in the M25.
	 * 
	 * For example, in the data set you will see two nodes:
	 * 
	 *      E13@6a(M1)&E30@21(M25)&M1@6a&M25@21 51.716288 -0.385208
	 * 		E30/M25@+M25(X14) 51.713257 -0.421343
	 * 
	 * These lines correspond to vertex #114 (the first one) and vertex #1196 (the second one).
	 * Because the label for both of these vertices includes "M25" this edge must not appear in 
	 * the copied graph, since it is a highway segment involving the M25.
	 * 
	 * Note that the edge is eliminated even when only one of the nodes involves M25.
